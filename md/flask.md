# Flask

Make sure you've Python installed in your system and has its version 3.10 or above.

Flask is listed on **requirements.txt** file, so that you can install some required modules including this, by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Pipenv
If you also use **pipenv**, you can also do that by running this command on your terminal: `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` to start the interactive shell of an pipenv environment. But if you don't have pipenv installed in your system run this command: `pip install pipenv`, and **pipenv** is ready to use.

To run the app, simply type this command: `py app.py` or `python3 app.py`
